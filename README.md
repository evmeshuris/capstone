Friday, 07.08.22
8:30 setup and schedule out day
8:50 start research into how to do api calls in JavaScript
9:30 read about API for Litter Robot (cat toilet)
10:00 found API https://v2.api.whisker.iothings.site/users/' + self._user_id + '/robots'
10:30 searching for the pictures for the html webpage
11:00 looking at css styles for the htmp webpage
11:30 continue research into api calls
1:30 created an account to see what data I can get from API
2:30 I think I have an idea for my capstone project. I have two cats and Litter-Robot toilet for them. I can call an API to see how many times the litter was used; if the litter is full; status. I will try right the function to do cleaning the litter
3:30 reading more about callbacks to be able to run the litter for cycle
